# DAP Inspector

This is a basic VS Code extension to play/try with debug adapters that support Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP). You can see the list of available DAP requests at [*Debug Adapter Protocol: Specification*][dap-reference].

[dap-reference]: https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol//specification.html#Requests

## Making DAP requests

To make a request follow these steps:

1. Start a debugging session and stop the debugger (like at some breakpoint).
1. Open a new text document (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>) and write the request body in it. For example, something like:
   ```json
   {
       "command": "threads"
   }
   ```
   or (if the request needs arguments):
   ```jsonc
   {
       "command": "stackTrace",
       "args": {
           "threadId": 00000 // Replace with the actual thread ID.
       }
   }
   ```
1. Run the *Send DAP Request* command by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and typing in "Send DAP Request".
1. If the request was valid (i.e., supported by the debug adapter) you see the response in a new text document:
   ```jsonc
   // threads
   {
        "threads": [
            {
                "id": 0,
                "name": "main.js [76961]"
            }
        ]
   }
   ```

## Features

- You can just **select** the request body in the active text editor and run the *Send DAP Request* command. This will **only** send the **selected text** as the request body, and is useful when you want to have **multiple requests** in a single file/document.
